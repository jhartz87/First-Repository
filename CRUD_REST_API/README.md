This is a REST API built with Spring Boot with CRUD functionalities. Or at least it's a work in progress getting the CRUD functionalities to work. 

The GET request works, had some trouble getting POST (create) request to work. Outlined the next steps I need to take to add PUT (update) and DELETE requests. Wanted to get the basic requests working then expand on the Collection class. 

Also this API needs more error handling and tests added to it too.
