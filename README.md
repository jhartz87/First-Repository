## DT Power Corp Website
Created for a client of PLC Marketing. Written with HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, and MS SQL database with a DNN framework. Also uses Google Web Service APIs for maps, reCAPTCHA, and analytics. Design is responsive with cross-browser compatability.

This site is pretty basic like a chick in yoga pants sipping a pumpkin spice latte. But it gets the job done and has all the classic website elements like a carousel, contact form, grid images with weird margins so you can't just use the basic bootstrap grid and then have fun making that grid responsive, buttons, drop-down menus, and intrigue.

Android and iOS apps created using Xamarin in Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac. Used HockeyApp for distribution and testing. Completed submission process for the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. 

These apps seem pretty simple in functionality but the entire app building process is extremely complex. One does not simply build an app. It is an art. Many kudos to all the full-time app developers out there. You the real heroes.

## Threads On Boston Website
Created for a client of PLC Marketing. Written with HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, and MS SQL database with a DNN framework. Also uses Google Web Service APIs for maps, reCAPTCHA, and analytics. Design is responsive with cross-browser compatability.

This site is very simple but so darn daper. Sometime I imagine this is how I'd dress if I wasn't so in love with athleisuring. Very sad when they cut out one of the most elegant (and time consuming) sections that involved double bordered images with some opacity effects and links. I commented that section out in case the client changes their mind to put it back in one day.

## Tradewinds Website

Created for a client of PLC Marketing. Written with HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, and MS SQL database with a DNN framework. Also uses Google Web Service APIs for search bar, reCAPTCHA, and analytics. Design is responsive with cross-browser compatability.

The menu on this site took so. much. JS/jQuery tweaking. It was a great, and by great I mean really, really long, learning experience. This site also uses a carousel that has to play nice with the drop down menu, tabs, submenus, and contact forms.

Scheduled to go live whenever-the-client-feels-like-it-but-can-you-get-those-code-changes-done-right-this-minute? The current site to be replaced with this masterpiece is http://tradewindspower.com/.

## UMKC ATTC Website Templates

Created for the University of Missouri - Kansas City. UMKC has a Network Coordinating Office for the Addiction Technology Transfer Center Network. ATTC has its own official national site, and the UMKC office needed their own site to host their local resources. Website templates written in HTML, CSS, and JS/jQuery.

The menu on this site is fancy (well, I mean, have you visited DT Power Corp yet?). It required icons, some in-depth JS/jQuery, and tweaking the CSS hover effect a lot. I like how function and flair meet on this site to make resources easy to find and easy to read.

## Unity Data Systems WordPress Theme

Current work in progress. Unity Data's main website is hosted on DNN but wants to use WP theme and CMS for the blog content. Unity Data hired another developer to create a WP theme, but it is written in HTML5 using WebFlow framework, which if you do any research into converting WP themes you would stay FAR FAR away from using WebFlow. The two main arguments for this is 1. WebFlow has its own simple CMS so why even bother converting and 2. WebFlow's HTML structure isn't strict HTML5 so converting to WP/PHP is tricky. For example, WebFlow doesn't use the usual \<ul\> \<li\> list structure for menus; it just uses containers, links, and CSS.
  
When it is finished, you will see it as part of this site: http://www.unitydatasystems.com
  
That WordPress so hot right now. WP/PHP is a great new skill to learn and one I've been wanting to do for awhile. I have my own WP blog that currently uses the free WP.com platform, but I dream a dream of one day of writing my own theme and hosting my own WP.org blog that probably just mostly my mother will read. Feels like time for a shameless plug: https://mountaindewatmidnight.com/

On a more serious note, if you are impressed with the work above and are in the market to contract a web developer for a functional and saavy-looking web solution, please contact my freelance company, Web Wizards LLC. https://webwizardsllc.com
